Abstract

   Each Regional Internet Registry (RIR) operates a public Registration
   Data Access Protocol (RDAP) service.  This document defines an RDAP
   profile for use by the RIRs, so as to increase consistency in service
   offerings and simplify the development of client software that uses
   those services.

<pre>1.  Introduction

   The RDAP protocol allows for significant operator flexibility as to
   how requests are handled, how responses are structured, and how much
   information is provided to clients.  Each of the RIRs operates an
   RDAP service, and while each service is broadly compliant with the
   protocol, there is substantial divergence among them in areas where
   the protocol explicitly permits that, as well as in areas where the
   protocol omits to define required behaviour.  This makes writing
   generic client software difficult: service-specific exceptions and
   workarounds need to be implemented, and default behaviours may be
   unnecessarily inefficient.

   Separately, with the exception of objectClassName, the protocol does
   not require that any particular element be present in a response: see
   Section 2.1 of [RFC7483].  It is open to operators as a matter of
   local policy to return elements in some cases and not others, which
   makes it difficult for client software authors to make any guarantees
   about how their software will operate.

   To address these problems in the number registry context, this
   document defines an RDAP profile for use by the RIRs, so as to
   increase consistency in service offerings and simplify the
   development of client software that uses those services.

<pre>1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].
</pre>
<a name="section-2"></a>
<pre>2.  Definitions

   These definitions are for the purposes of this document only.

   An RIR that has had Internet Number Resources (INRs) delegated to it
   is defined as having "delegation authority" over those resources.
   For example, IANA has delegated 103/8 to APNIC, so APNIC has



                                                                [Page 2]
</pre>
<pre>
                            NRO RDAP Profile                January 2021


   "delegation authority" over 103/8.  Delegation authority is not
   exclusive: multiple RIRs may have delegation authority over a given
   INR at a given point in time.

   An RIR that has had INRs delegated to it, and has not further
   delegated those resources to another RIR after the last instance of
   those resources being delegated to it, is defined as having
   "registration authority" over those resources.  Registration
   authority is exclusive: only one RIR may have registration authority
   over a given INR at a given point in time.

   An RIR may have only delegation authority over a set of resources:
   this occurs e.g. where an RIR has transferred resources to another
   RIR (the source RIR has only delegation authority, in this case).  An
   RIR cannot have registration authority for resources without also
   having delegation authority for those resources, though: in the
   inter-RIR transfer case, the recipient RIR has both delegation
   authority and registration authority over the resources.

<pre>3.  Common Data Types
</pre>
<a name="section-3.1"></a>
<pre>3.1.  Domain Names

   Trailing periods MUST be included in "ldhName" and "unicodeName"
   values.
</pre>
<a name="section-4"></a>
<pre>4.  Common Data Structures
</pre>
<a name="section-4.1"></a>
<pre>4.1.  RDAP Conformance

   Each response MUST include an rdapConformance element.  The service
   MUST conform with RFC 7483 [RFC7483], so "rdap_level_0" will be
   included as an rdapConformance value in each response.

   To signify conformance with this specification, the string literal
   "nro_rdap_profile_0" MUST be included as an rdapConformance value in
   each response.

   The service MUST implement the "cidr0" extension (registered with
   IANA), so the string literal "cidr0" MUST be included as an
   rdapConformance value in each response.

   The "Query Processing" section for autnums requires services to
   include an additional rdapConformance value for the autnum processing
   logic that is being used.

   Other rdapConformance values MAY be included.




                                                                [Page 3]

</pre>
<a name="section-4.2"></a>
<pre>4.2.  Links

   Each object, including nested objects, MUST include a link with the
   "self" link relation type, pointing to the object.  See Section 5 of
   [RFC7483].
</pre>
<a name="section-4.3"></a>
<pre>4.3.  Notices and Remarks

   Each response MUST include a notices element in the topmost object.

   Each response MUST include a notice containing details on the terms
   and conditions of use of the service.  This notice MUST contain a
   link with a link relation type of "terms-of-service".

   Each response MUST include a notice containing details on how to
   report inaccurate Whois data.  This notice MUST contain a link with a
   link relation type of "inaccuracy-report".

   Other notices MAY be included.
</pre>
<a name="section-4.4"></a>
<pre>4.4.  Events

   Each response that includes an RDAP object as the topmost object
   SHOULD include a "registration" event and a "last changed" event for
   that object.  This may not be possible for all objects: for example,
   event data for legacy IP network objects is often missing or
   unreliable.
</pre>
<a name="section-4.5"></a>
<pre>4.5.  Status

   Each Internet Number Resource (INR) object that represents a
   delegation from an RIR for operational use in a network, or for
   further sub-delegation for such use, MUST have a status of "active".
   A status of "active" does not necessarily mean that the associated
   resources will be in use on the public Internet.

   Each INR object that represents an entry in one of the special-
   purpose address registries ([SPAR-IPV4], [SPAR-IPV6], [SPAR-ASN])
   MUST have a status of "reserved".

   Each INR object that represents a delegation that is less-specific
   than a delegation that has a status of "active", and does not also
   have a status of "active", MUST have a status of "administrative".
   For example, the object representing a delegation of resources from
   IANA to an RIR would fall into this category.

<a name="section-5.1"></a>
<pre>5.1.  The Entity Object Class
</pre>
<a name="section-5.1.1"></a>
<pre>5.1.1.  jCards

   The following properties may be used in Entity jCards:

      kind;

      fn;

      n;

      adr;

      tel;

      email;

      lang;

      geo;

      title;

      role;

      org;

      version; and

      contact-uri.

   Each jCard MUST contain a "kind" property.  The value of that
   property MUST be "individual", "group", or "org".

   A "geo" property MUST have a type of "uri".  A "tel" property MUST
   have a type of "uri" or "text".  A "lang" property MUST have a type
   of "language-tag".  A "contact-uri" property MUST have a type of
   "uri".  All other properties MUST have a type of "text".

   An "adr" property MUST include a "label" parameter, containing the
   content of the delivery address as a single string.

   Properties may include "language", "altid", and "pref" parameters.





                                                                [Page 5]
</pre>
<pre>
                            NRO RDAP Profile                January 2021


   "email", "org" and "adr" properties may include a "type" parameter.
   The "type" parameter values that may be used are "work" and "home".

   A "tel" property may include a "type" parameter.  The "type"
   parameter values that may be used are those defined in [RFC6350].

   An "adr" property may include a "cc" parameter.  This parameter may
   be set even when the "country name" component of the property's value
   is not set.

   Properties, types, and parameters not expressly permitted by way of
   this profile MUST NOT be used.
</pre>
<a name="section-5.1.2"></a>
<pre>5.1.2.  Other

   Each top-level entity object that has the "registrant" role for one
   or more IP networks MUST include a "networks" element containing only
   those IP networks.  The "networks" element MUST NOT be included in
   other types of entity object.

   Each top-level entity object that has the "registrant" role for one
   or more autnums MUST include an "autnums" element containing only
   those autnums.  The "autnums" element MUST NOT be included in other
   types of entity object.

   Services MAY limit the number of associated networks or autnums that
   are included in an entity object.  However, the limit MUST NOT be
   zero.
</pre>
<a name="section-5.2"></a>
<pre>5.2.  The Domain Object Class

   Each domain object MUST include an "ldhName" element.

   Each domain object MUST include a "network" element, if the reverse
   domain maps to an IP network object.  This applies regardless of
   whether that network has a status of "active".

   Each domain object MUST include a "nameservers" element.  For
   services that do not support nameserver queries, objects within this
   element will not include a "self" link, and are an exception to the
   earlier statement that all objects must include a "self" link.
</pre>
<a name="section-5.3"></a>
<pre>5.3.  INR Entities

   Each INR object SHOULD include a nested entity with the "abuse" role
   for the INR.  If the entity is present, its jCard [RFC7095] MUST
   include a contact email address.  This nested entity would only be
   missing from the response when the registry does not have the



                                                                [Page 6]

   relevant data, or is compelled by the registry's regulatory
   environment to omit it.

   Each INR object SHOULD include a nested entity with the "registrant"
   role for the INR.
</pre>
<a name="section-5.4"></a>
<pre>5.4.  The IP Network Object Class

   Each IP network object MUST include "handle", "startAddress",
   "endAddress", "ipVersion", and "status" elements.
</pre>

<pre>6.1.1.  IP Networks

   An RIR that receives a query for an IP network for which it has only
   partial delegation authority MUST return a valid IP network object
   response, being the most-specific administrative object that
   encompasses the IP network.

   An RIR that receives a query for an IP network for which it has
   delegation authority, but for which it has only partial registration
   authority, MUST return a valid IP network object response, being the
   most-specific administrative object that encompasses the IP network.

   An RIR that receives a query for an IP network for which it has
   delegation authority, but for which it does not have registration
   authority (including partial registration authority), MUST redirect
   the query to either the RIR to which it most recently transferred
   delegation authority, or the RIR that currently has registration
   authority.

   An RIR that receives a query for an IP network for which it has
   registration authority but that has not been further delegated by the
   RIR to one of its own accounts (i.e. that does not fall within the
   bounds of an IP network object with a status of "active") MUST return
   a valid IP network object response, being the most-specific
   administrative object that encompasses the IP network.

   An RIR that receives a query for an IP network for which it has never
   had delegation authority MAY redirect the query to the RIR that



                                                                [Page 7]

   currently has registration authority for the IP network, or (if no
   single registry has registration authority) to an RIR that has
   delegation authority for the IP network.  If an RIR does not
   implement this behaviour, or if no single registry has delegation
   authority, the RIR MUST respond with a "404 Not Found" response.

   An RIR MAY respond to queries for IP networks that have not been
   delegated (in whole or in part) to it or to another RIR (e.g. the IP
   networks from one of the special-purpose address registries
   ([SPAR-IPV4], [SPAR-IPV6], [SPAR-ASN])).
</pre>
<a name="section-6.1.2"></a>
<pre>6.1.2.  Autnums

   For autnum queries, there is a set of common requirements.  After
   that, an RIR has two options for processing autnum queries: a
   hierarchical model, or a flat model.
</pre>
<a name="section-6.1.2.1"></a>
<pre>6.1.2.1.  Common requirements

   An RIR that receives a query for an autnum for which it has
   delegation authority, but for which it does not have registration
   authority, MUST redirect the query to either the RIR to which it most
   recently transferred delegation authority, or the RIR that currently
   has registration authority.

   An RIR that receives a query for an autnum for which it has never had
   delegation authority MAY redirect the query to the RIR that currently
   has registration authority for the autnum.  If an RIR does not
   implement this behaviour, the RIR MUST respond with a "404 Not Found"
   response.

   An RIR MAY respond to queries for autnums that have not been
   delegated (in whole or in part) to it or to another RIR.
</pre>
<a name="section-6.1.2.2"></a>
<pre>6.1.2.2.  Hierarchical model

   An RIR that receives a query for an autnum for which it has
   registration authority but that has not been further delegated by the
   RIR to one of its own accounts (i.e. that does not fall within the
   bounds of an IP network object with a status of "active") MUST return
   a valid autnum object response, being the most-specific
   administrative object that encompasses the IP network.

   To signify use of the hierarchical model, the string literal
   "nro_rdap_profile_asn_hierarchical_0" MUST be included as an
   rdapConformance value in each response.





                                                                [Page 8]

</pre>
<a name="section-6.1.2.3"></a>
<pre>6.1.2.3.  Flat model

   An RIR that receives a query for an autnum for which it has
   registration authority but that has not been further delegated by the
   RIR to one of its own accounts MUST respond with a "404 Not Found"
   response.

   To signify use of the flat model, the string literal
   "nro_rdap_profile_asn_flat_0" MUST be included as an rdapConformance
   value in each response.
</pre>
<a name="section-6.2"></a>
<pre>6.2.  Domains

   RIRs do not host forward domains.  A query for a forward domain MAY
   be redirected in accordance with the bootstrap logic defined in RFC
   7484.

   An RIR that receives a query for a reverse domain, where the RIR has
   delegation authority but not registration authority over the
   corresponding INR, MUST redirect the query to either the RIR to which
   it transferred delegation authority, or the RIR that currently has
   registration authority.

   An RIR that receives a query for a reverse domain, where the RIR has
   never had delegation authority for the corresponding INR, MAY
   redirect the query to the RIR that currently has registration
   authority for the INR.

   If an RIR receives a query for a reverse domain that does not exist,
   where a "closest encloser" (see Section 3.3 of [RFC4592]) of the
   reverse domain does exist, then the RIR MUST respond as if the query
   had been for that closest encloser.  This does not apply if the
   closest encloser is "in-addr.arpa" or "ip6.arpa".
</pre>
<a name="section-6.3"></a>
<pre>6.3.  Nameserver

   Nameserver queries MAY be supported.  If a service does not support
   nameserver queries, it MUST respond with a "501 Not Implemented"
   response.
</pre>
<a name="section-6.4"></a>
<pre>6.4.  Help

   Services MUST respond to "help" queries with a valid RDAP object
   containing the default set of notices for the service.

   The rdapConformance element in the response MUST include the
   extension identifiers for all of the extensions implemented by the
   service.



                                                                [Page 9]

<pre>6.5.  Delegated service
</pre>
<a name="section-6.5.1"></a>
<pre>6.5.1.  Preliminary

   An RIR may delegate resources in such a way that the holder of those
   resources runs a separate RDAP service for those queries.  When the
   RIR receives a query for resources that have been delegated in this
   way, it may either redirect (via HTTP) to the remote RDAP service, or
   answer the query in some other way (e.g. by hosting a local copy of
   that remote RDAP service's data).

   A client who receives an HTTP redirect from a service to a non-RIR
   RDAP service should be prepared to receive responses that are not in
   compliance with this profile.

   An RIR that responds to a query for resources that have been
   delegated in this way in its own right MUST ensure that the response
   is in compliance with this profile.

   An RIR that responds to a query for resources that have been
   delegated in this way by redirecting to another service MUST
   implement the "redirect_with_content" extension (registered with
   IANA).
</pre>
<a name="section-6.5.2"></a>
<pre>6.5.2.  Application

   This profile has various provisions that are specific to the RIRs,
   and do not apply to delegated service operators.  To avoid any doubt,
   a non-RIR RDAP service that implements this profile is not required
   to support any of the behaviour specified in the "Query Processing"
   section.

<pre>7.  Error Responses

   The title of an error response MUST be the reason phrase (see
   [RFC7231]) associated with the errorCode of the error response.

   The description of an error response SHOULD describe the error in
   more detail (i.e. in more detail than the associated HTTP reason
   phrase).
</pre>
<a name="section-8"></a>
<pre>8.  Indicating Truncated Responses

   A truncated response MUST indicate that it is truncated by way of a
   typed notice or a typed remark, as described in Section 9 of
   [RFC7483].
